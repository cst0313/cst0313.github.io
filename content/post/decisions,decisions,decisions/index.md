This would be the second year I'm fighting for the Student of the Year Award. 
{{< spoiler text="What the Student of the Year Award is" >}}
Organised by South China Morning Post (SCMP), Student of the Year Awards 2022/23 is gathering nominations. It is an annual event that recognises the outstanding achievements of secondary school students in academic subjects, visual and performing arts, music, sports, community service, and leadership. Each year, hundreds of students are nominated for these prestigious prizes. They are judged based on clearly defined criteria, which include all-round academic performance, personal reflections on a given topic, other awards and recognition, and involvement in community service.
{{< /spoiler >}}
A previous student from Hong Kong who won in both the "Scientist and Mathematician" and "Grand Prize" categories, Dylan, got into my dream school, MIT. "Perhaps if I won the award, I would have a better chance at getting in," the na√Øve me thought back then. Looking back right now, I notice that however many awards I got, I would still be me. If someone suddenly gave me a medal, I wouldn't be better in any way than my original self without the medal.

After filling in a whole application form, getting the principal's signature and scanning dozens of my certificates, combining them into a pdf file, I submitted the application to my teacher with hope. Unfortunately, except from getting an email from SCMP giving me one month of free subscription, there was nothing. I witnessed as others in the training camp got their final interview offers, one by one. My heart sank deeper and deeper. In the end, I was heartbroken to find some "management procedures" had gone wrong, and the judging panel didn't even have the chance to consider my application. Not even a confirmation or rejection letter. And that was the end of my supposed journey in the academic year.

This year, the Hong Kong Academy for Gifted Education (HKAGE) started a nomination scheme; those from Secondary 4 to Secondary 6 who were HKAGE members could apply through them and gain their nomination. As I am writing this, the 12:00 deadline is approaching to submit their application form. This being the first year that HKAGE could directly nominate students, I knew I would stand out amongst other applicants applying from their respective schools if I chose to go down the HKAGE path. It was a promising choice.
